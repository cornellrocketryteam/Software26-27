# CSV Logging Implementation

## Overview
The fill station automatically logs all system states to a CSV file on startup. This includes state information from actuators (SVs), the ADCs, and any connected Flight Software (FSW) received over the Umbilical. The logger runs continuously in the background at **100 Hz**.

## File Management
- **Location:** Logs are saved to `/tmp/data` on Linux (the TI board), or `logs/` on macOS/Windows.
- **Naming Convention:** `fill_station_log_<UNIX_TIMESTAMP>.csv`
- **File Continuation:** To prevent data loss from accidental overwrites, consecutive runs started within the same second will append a suffix (e.g., `_1`, `_2`) so that every new run gets its own brand-new CSV file.
- **Persistence:** The file flushes (syncs to disk) every 10 seconds (1,000 samples) to ensure data is preserved even in the event of an abrupt power cycle.

## Logged Data Columns

The CSV file contains the following columns, exactly matching the order below. If a component (like the ADCs or FSW over Umbilical) fails to return fresh data, their respective columns will be populated with `"N/A"`.

### Header Structure

**Timing and General Actuators:**
- `Loop`: Monotonically increasing loop counter starting at 1.
- `Timestamp_ms`: Unix timestamp of the data point.
- `Igniter1_Active`, `Igniter2_Active`: Boolean indicating if the igniter is currently fired.

**Solenoid Valves:** (Columns repeat for SV1 through SV5)
- `SV<N>_Open`: Boolean indicating if the valve is open.
- `SV<N>_Cont`: Boolean continuity state.

**Fill-Station MAV:**
- `MAV_Open`: Boolean last-commanded open state.
- `MAV_Pulse_US`: Last-commanded servo pulse width (µs).

**Analog to Digital Converters (ADCs):** (Columns repeat for ADC1 and ADC2, Channels 0 through 3)
- `ADC<NUM>_<CH>_Raw`: 12-bit raw integer reading.
- `ADC<NUM>_<CH>_Scaled`: Calibrated sensor value — PT1 (ADC1 Ch0), PT2 (ADC1 Ch2), Load Cell (ADC2 Ch1). `N/A` for all other channels.

**Umbilical Telemetry (FSW):**
- `FSW_Connected`: True if the ground station has an active CDC-ACM serial umbilical connection to the flight software.
- `FSW_Mode`: Flight system state machine mode (Standby, Ascent, etc).
- `FSW_Pressure`, `FSW_Temp`, `FSW_Altitude`: Base barometric data.
- `FSW_Lat`, `FSW_Lon`, `FSW_Sats`: GPS positional data.
- `FSW_Timestamp`: Uptime on the FSW.
- `FSW_MagX`, `FSW_MagY`, `FSW_MagZ`: Internal magnetometer.
- `FSW_AccelX`, `FSW_AccelY`, `FSW_AccelZ`: Internal accelerometer.
- `FSW_GyroX`, `FSW_GyroY`, `FSW_GyroZ`: Internal gyroscope.
- `FSW_PT3`, `FSW_PT4`, `FSW_RTD`: Remote pressures and RTD temperatures on the vehicle.

**QD Stepper:**
- `QD_Enabled`: Boolean indicating if the stepper driver ENA pin is high (driver enabled).
- `QD_Direction`: Boolean indicating the current DIR pin state (`true` = open direction).
