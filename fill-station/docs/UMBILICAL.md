# Umbilical Connection

The `fill-station` software now includes an **Umbilical** connection to the Flight Software (FSW). This feature allows the fill station to act as a bridge between the ground control clients (via WebSocket) and the FSW running on the vehicle (via a USB CDC-ACM serial connection).

## Architecture

The umbilical connection revolves around a background task in `src/main.rs` that polls `/dev/ttyACM0` at a default rate. The hardware implementation is transparent to the end user and handled via `smol`'s async channels.

## Features

- **Telemetry Parsing**: The FSW emits one telemetry record per line as `$TELEM,<54 comma-separated fields>\n`. The umbilical task line-buffers the serial stream, parses each `$TELEM,` line via `FswTelemetry::from_csv` (strict 54-field match — see `TELEM_FIELD_COUNT`), and broadcasts the result over WebSocket. Non-`$TELEM` lines are forwarded to debug logs.
- **Sync on (re)connect**: The first two newline-terminated chunks after opening the serial port are discarded so a partial line picked up mid-stream cannot produce a garbage frame.
- **Line buffer cap**: If `\n` never arrives (FSW hung mid-line), the line buffer is cleared with a warning at 8 KB.
- **Dump suppression**: While the FSW is mid-flash-dump it sets an internal `DUMP_IN_PROGRESS` flag and stops emitting `$TELEM` lines. Telemetry pauses for the duration of the dump and resumes automatically afterward.
- **FSW Command Translation**: JSON commands received via WebSocket are forwarded over the umbilical as `<X>`-style ASCII tokens to the FSW.

### FSW Telemetry Data Structure

`FswTelemetry` is parsed from the 54 CSV fields of each `$TELEM,` line in `src/components/umbilical.rs`. The fields, in order, are:

## WebSocket API Extentions

When streaming FSW telemetry (`start_fsw_stream`), clients receive JSON updates. 

### Stream Commands
- `start_fsw_stream`: Start streaming parsed telemetry from FSW over WebSocket.
- `stop_fsw_stream`: Stop streaming telemetry.

### FSW Actuation Commands
Commands sent over the WebSocket that get parsed and sent across the serial connection to FSW:
- `fsw_launch`: Trigger Launch sequence (`<L>`).
- `fsw_trigger_drogue`: Trigger drogue deploy on FSW (test only) (`<D>`).
- `fsw_trigger_main`: Trigger main deploy on FSW (test only) (`<d>`).
