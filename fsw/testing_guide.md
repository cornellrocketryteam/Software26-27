# Pico 2 Flight Software Testing Guide

This guide details how to compile and run specific verification test loops directly on the Raspberry Pi Pico 2.

We use **Cargo Feature Flags** to isolate these tests. This guarantees that test code is completely isolated and never accidentally compiled into the production flight software binary. Once you run a given test command, the microcontroller will bypass its normal flight loop and execute the isolated test loop indefinitely until disconnected.

## 🚀 Getting Started (For New Users)

If you have entirely fresh hardware and want to run these tests, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/cornellrocketryteam/Software25-26.git
   cd Software25-26/fsw
   ```

2. **Checkout the FSW Branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout fsw-spring26
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**
   Ensure you have Rust and the `picotool` toolchain installed for your Pico 2. On a Mac, you can install this using Homebrew:
   ```bash
   brew install picotool
   ```

4. **Connect the Hardware**
   Plug the Raspberry Pi Pico 2 into your computer via USB. Hold the `BOOTSEL` button on the board while plugging it in.

## 🛠️ Hardware Testing Commands

Run the following commands while inside the `fsw/` directory.

### 1. Combined Full Hardware Sequence
Tests all major sensors, actuates the Main Valve, actuates the Solenoid Valve, and fires the Drogue parachute in a repeating loop.

```bash
cargo run --features "test_hw_all"
```

### 2. Main Actuation Valve (MAV)
Repeatedly actuates the MAV Open for 2.5 seconds, then actuates it Closed, and waits 5 seconds before repeating.

```bash
cargo run --features "test_mav"
```

### 3. Solenoid Valve (SV)
Repeatedly actuates the SV Open for 2 seconds, then actuates it Closed, and waits 5 seconds before repeating.

```bash
cargo run --features "test_sv"
```

### 4. Parachutes / Solid State Arrays (SSA)
Fires the Drogue Chute pin for 2 seconds, then immediately fires the Main Chute pin for 2 seconds, waiting 5 seconds before repeating.

```bash
cargo run --features "test_ssa"
```

### 5. Buzzer
Triggers the buzzer 3 times, waits 2 seconds, then triggers the buzzer 2 times, waiting 5 seconds before repeating.

```bash
cargo run --features "test_buzzer"
```

### 6. Sensor Verification (Telemetry Spam)
The fastest way to verify all sensor connections. Bypasses the flight state machine and spams a rapid stream of direct readings from the BMP390, GPS, IMU, Magnetometer, and ADC directly to your computer console.

```bash
cargo run --features "test_sensors"
```

### 7. Radio Transceiver (rfd900x)
Tests the radio transceiver of the RFD900x radio.

- **Pico 1 (TX/RX):** Transmits telemetry and listens for packets.
  ```bash
  cargo run --features "test_radio_tx"
  ```
- **Pico 2 (RX Only):** Listens for telemetry packets from Pico 1 and prints decoded data.
  ```bash
  cargo run --features "test_radio_rx"
  ```

This test uses a 4-byte sync word (`0x3E5D5967`) to ensure packets are correctly aligned even if boards are started at different times.

## 💻 Simulation Testing Commands

Software-in-the-loop tests validate the logic transitions without requiring physical sensors.

### 1. Simple Flight Simulation
Simulates an ideal flight profile with normal state transitions.
```bash
cargo run --features "sim_simple"
```

### 2. Fault Simulation
Injects sensor faults to ensure the flight state transitions to Fault correctly.
```bash
cargo run --features "sim_fault"
```

### 3. Stability Simulation
Validates that the software doesn't unexpectedly transition to a mode when the condition isn't satisfied.
```bash
cargo run --features "sim_stability"
```

### 4. Extra Features Simulation
Tests MAV timeout, manual mode changes, and payload communication works with flight loop.
```bash
cargo run --features "sim_extra"
```

### 5. Hardware-in-the-loop Simulation (HSIM)
Fakes the altimeter data while running the flight loop and actuating the hardware.
```bash
cargo run --features "sim_hsim"
```

### 6. QSPI Flash Storage Simulation
Writes mock flight packet data to the onboard Flash memory chip and reads it back to verify data.
```bash
cargo run --features "sim_flash"
```

### 7. Combined Full Simulation Sequence
Runs all of the above simulations sequentially.
```bash
cargo run --features "sim_all"
```

---

## 🌐 Unified Testing Command

### Test Everything (Software & Hardware)
Sequentially runs all software simulations (`sim_all`) and then enters the continuous hardware testing loop (`test_hw_all`).

```bash
cargo run --features "test_all"
```

## ✈️ Returning to Normal Flight Mode

To compile and load the actual, production Flight Software state machine, simply run `cargo run` without supplying any test feature flags:

```bash
cargo run
```
